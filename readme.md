Yakari is simply in memory cache distributor.

Project is aimed to reduce distributed caching systems serialization/deserialization and network operation costs.
You simply work with your localCache, the GreatEagle observe's your operations and take care of everything.
In yakari if you set 1 object it makes 1 serialization and 1 network operation, for first get operation it makes 1 network operation, 1 deserialization, after then there is no deserialization or network operation you can get your cache object from your localCache, how much you want. 

How to Install:
`
Install-Package Yakari.Pack -Pre
`

Under heavy development, don't try anything fancy, just wait for developments(Press **Watch** if you really curious...)

Currently unit tests are passing but there are lot more to do...
